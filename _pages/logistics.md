## Assessments
The final course grade will be calculated using the following categories:

    | Assessment              | Percentage of Final Grade |
    |-------------------------|---------------------------|
    | Class Participation     | 10%                       |
    | Paper Reading Assignment| 20%                       |
    | Online Homework         | 20%                       |
    | Course Project          | 50%                       |


* **Class participation.** The grading of the class participation will be mostly based on attendance, checked by in-class polls and asking and answering questions in class. Other factors include asking and answering questions on Piazza.
* **Paper reading assignment.** The course will require all students to complete several paper reading assignments individually. In each assignment, the students are required to provide a summary of the paper/article, questions, and discussion.
<!-- * The assignments will be submitted through Canvas and will be peer-reviewed, but the final score will be provided by the instructor and the TA. -->
* **Online homework.** The course will require all students to complete several online homework assignments individually. Each assignment will involve checking the understanding of basic concepts and working through the algorithms presented in class on example problems. Most questions are multiple-choice questions or numerical answer questions but the students need to submit explanations separately.
* **Course project.**
  * **17-537**
    * Students will have the flexibility to choose between two options for the course project:
      * **Kaggle Competition**
        * Students will participate in *one* of the Kaggle competitions, which involve real-world data and require practical application of ML techniques.
        * Competitions (Subject to change)
          * [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction)
          * [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview)
        * Students are expected to analyze the problem and dataset provided in their chosen competition and propose appropriate ML techniques and strategies to solve the problem. Students can discuss multiple approaches and explain the rationale behind selecting a specific method.
      * **Writing a blog on AI for Social Good**
        * Students will write a blog post on a topic related to AI for Social Good. The blog post should be written in a way that is accessible to a general audience. The final version of the blog post will be published on the course website as a separate webpage.
          * Target audience: The post should be written at a level so that any senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science can have a good understanding of the overall societal challenge, the problem statement, the AI method, how the AI method helps address the societal challenge, the evaluation, and the impact. In addition, a big portion of the post (at least 50%) should be easily understandable by the general public.
          * Content: The blog post must present a self-contained, cogent, and engaging narrative on this line of research, including a blend of scientific (high - level) and technical exposition.
          * Figures/gifs/tables/videos that add to the exposition and enhance understanding are needed
          * Bibliography optional but inline references to attributions made in the text should be given
        * Submission format: markdown or pdf; to submit the blog post, you can either upload to canvas, or submit a pull request to the [course website repo](https://github.com/AIandSocialGoodLab/17737s24) (instruction coming up later).
    * Students are expected to work **individually** on these projects.

  * **17-737**
    * Students will work in small groups (1-3 students in each group) on a project exploring the possibility of using AI to help address a social good problem. The students are expected to focus on one or more societal challenges, propose models and AI-based solutions to tackle the challenges and evaluate the solutions.
  * **Grading Criteria**
    * For **17-537 Kaggle Competition and 17-737**: students are required to submit a project report through Canvas, and deliver an oral presentation in class. The progress of projects will be checked through the Project Proposal, Project Progress Report, Oral Presentation, and Final Project Report. The proposal and progress report will be peer-reviewed. The presentation and the final report will be evaluated by the instructor and TA directly.
    * For **17-537 Blog Post**:
      * The blog post will be graded based on the following aspects:
        * Scientific exposition w.r.t target audience
          * Why is this societal problem important?
          * What's the main challenge?
          * How does it fit into the broader context of AI for Social Good?
          * What's the main high-level idea of the AI method?
        * Technical exposition w.r.t target audience
          * What are the specific AI techniques used?
          * How does the AI method help address the societal challenge?
          * What are the obstacles and challenges in applying the AI method?
        * Overall structure and organization

## Grading Policies
* **Late-work policy**: All late submissions will be graded with a 0.7 discount.
* **Re-grade policy**: To request a re-grade, the student needs to make a private piazza post titled “Re-grade request from [Student’s Full Name]” visible to instructors within one week of receiving the graded assignment.
* **Attendance and participation policy**: Attendance and participation will be a graded component of the course. The grading of the class participation will be mostly based on attendance, checked by in-class quizzes and asking and answering questions in class. Other factors include asking and answering questions on Piazza.

## Course Policies
* Academic integrity & collaboration: For both paper reading assignments and written answer assignments, a student can discuss with other students, but they need to specify the names of the students they discussed with in the submission or comment area of the submission and complete the calculations, summary, and questions on their own. For the course project, the students can discuss and collaborate with others (including students, faculty members, and domain experts), but the students need to give proper credits to whoever is involved and report the contributions of each group member in the final report and presentations, which will be considered in the grading. For assignments and the course project, it is allowed to use publicly available code packages but the source of the code package needs to be specified in the submission. Plagiarism is not allowed. The policy is motivated by CMU's policy on academic integrity which can be found [here](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/index.html).
* Mobile devices: Mobile devices are allowed in class. Cellphones should be in silent mode. Students who use tablets in upright positions and laptops will be asked to sit in the back rows of the classroom.
* Accommodations for students with disabilities: If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu. If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.
* Statement on student wellness: As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus [here](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/). Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
